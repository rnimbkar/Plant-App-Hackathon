# Plant-App-Hackathon
#Need help taking care of your plants? Can't make them stay alive longer than a week? Garden Guru helps users learn more about their leafy friends in order to better care for them and help them thrive!
#We have created a comprehensive database that a user can access in either of two ways:
Input the name of the house plant
Upload a photo of the plant and Garden Guru will use AI to determine what plant you have 
Output:
Watering frequency
Soil conditions
Pot size
Our innovative image recognition functionality ensures that a user can properly care for their plant without an extensive botanical knowledge or experience, which makes the app more accessible to all.
#Our app utilizes Open AI API (GPT 4o) which supports image processing and a csv file that holds the plant info database
